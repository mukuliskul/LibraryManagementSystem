# Library Management System

## Overview

This Library Management System is a comprehensive solution for managing library operations, designed in C++. It includes functionality for handling books, publications, and user interactions within a library setting. The system is structured into several modules, each handling a specific aspect of library management.

## Skills

Working on this project will help in developing a range of skills, particularly for those interested in software development, system design, and library management. Key skills include:

- **C++ Programming:** Deepening understanding of C++ concepts such as object-oriented programming, data structures, and file handling.
- **System Design:** Gaining insights into designing modular and scalable systems.
- **User Interface Design:** Learning about creating user-friendly interfaces and menus in a console environment.
- **Data Management:** Enhancing skills in managing and manipulating data, particularly in the context of a library system.
- **Problem-Solving:** Developing strong problem-solving skills by implementing functional requirements and debugging.

## Experience Gained

Contributors to this project will gain valuable experience in several areas:

- **Real-world Application Development:** Experience in developing a complete application that simulates real-world library management.
- **Software Development Lifecycle:** Understanding various stages of software development, from planning and design to implementation and testing.
- **System Integration:** Learning how to integrate different modules to work seamlessly together to form a cohesive application.
- **Debugging and Testing:** Skills in identifying and fixing bugs, and ensuring the reliability and robustness of the application.

## Files and Modules

The project directory structure is organized as follows:

- `src` directory: Contains all the `.cpp` files.
- `include` directory: Contains all the `.h` files.
- `data` directory: Contains example text files used to simulate the library database.

### `src/Book.cpp`

- **Header File:** `include/Book.h`
- Implements the `Book` class, which manages book-related data such as titles, authors, and ISBN. This module is essential for the library's inventory management, allowing efficient tracking and categorization of books.

### `src/Date.cpp`

- **Header File:** `include/Date.h`
- Contains the `Date` class for handling dates within the application. This class is utilized for date-related operations like due dates for book returns, issue dates, and other time-sensitive features in the library system.

### `src/LibApp.cpp`

- **Header File:** `include/LibApp.h`
- Forms the core of the library application. This module integrates various components of the system, orchestrating functionalities like book management, user interactions, and overall application flow.

### `src/LibAppMain.cpp`

- Serves as the entry point of the application. This file contains the `main` function, which initializes and launches the library application. It's the starting block for running the system.

### `src/Menu.cpp`

- **Header File:** `include/Menu.h`
- Implements user interface elements, particularly the menu options. This module is crucial for user interaction, enabling library patrons and staff to navigate through different functionalities of the system.

### `src/Publication.cpp`

- **Header File:** `include/Publication.h`
- Includes the `Publication` class, potentially serving as a base or a specialized class for different types of publications available in the library, such as books, journals, magazines, etc.

### `src/PublicationSelector.cpp`

- **Header File:** `include/PublicationSelector.h`
- Provides utilities or components for selecting publications. This module likely aids in searching, filtering, or listing various publications in the library, enhancing user experience and accessibility.

### `src/Streamable.cpp`

- **Header File:** `include/Streamable.h`
- Possibly contains an implementation of a `Streamable` class or interface. This module might be used for streaming data or defining a common interface for different types of streamable media or data within the library system.

### `include/Lib.h`

- The `Lib.h` module in the `include` directory defines several constants that are used throughout the project. The use case for these constants can be found as comments inside the header file.

## Usage (Compilation and Running)

To compile and run the Library Management System, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed, such as GCC or Clang.
2. Compile the source files. For example, using GCC:
   ```
   g++ -Wall -std=c++11 -o LibApp src/*.cpp
   ```
3. Run the compiled application:
   ```
   ./LibApp
   ```
